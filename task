UI Code Review & Enhancement

I will be sending you code (mostly written using Tailwind CSS) from a UI project.

### üîß Your Tasks:
1. **Analyze and enhance the code** to make it **fully responsive**, with **mobile-first design principles**.
2. Ensure the layout is **modern and visually appealing** for both **mobile** and **desktop** views.
3. You are allowed to return the updated code in either **Tailwind CSS** or **traditional CSS**, whichever gives the best structure.
4. Use **clear, well-organized layout decisions** based on best practices.

### üì± Mobile Design Expectations:
- Design must **default to mobile-first**, and then expand to desktop using **media queries**.
- Add or fix **hamburger menu icon + toggle functionality** for **mobile devices only**, so users can expand/collapse the **Aside Navigation Bar**.
- Ensure **interactive UI components** (e.g., buttons, modals, forms, etc) are appropriately sized and spaced for touch devices.
- Increase **text sizes and padding** for small screens for readability.

---

### üñ• Desktop Design Expectations:
- Ensure that layout adjusts gracefully with larger screen widths using media queries (`@media (min-width:...)`).
- Use **multi-column layouts** when needed (e.g., summary cards, tables).
- Maintain a clean, professional look with appropriate white space.

üìö Global UI Rules
Always include an Aside Navigation Bar on every page.

Use this default nav structure and automatically highlight the active page based on the current page:

üß≠ Aside Navigation Bar Structure (Sticky Left Sidebar)
Dashboard

Live Orders

Order History

Wallet & Payments

Messages & Notifications

Profile

Rewards

Logout

Notes:

Highlight the active page visually (e.g., using bg-blue-100 or text-blue-600 font-bold).

For mobile, hide the nav bar by default and toggle it with a hamburger icon.

Use fixed or sticky position with proper z-index handling.

The aside should collapse neatly and expand on icon tap.

---

### üîÅ Consistency:
- Maintain or improve the **design logic and layout hierarchy**.
- Preserve **functionality and features** already present (e.g., buttons, input fields, ad containers. etc).
- You are allowed to **enhance UX and visuals** if it improves usability.
